# Performance-Evaluation-of-Digital-Modulation-Schemes-over-Diverse-Wireless-Channel-Models-
This MATLAB-based project  evaluates the Bit Error Rate performance and signal reconstruction capabilities of various digital modulation schemes across multiple wireless channel modules.

Every modulation Techniques with analog signal as input signal is evaluated in different channels mentioned below Excel performance summary csv file is generated and heat map is used for easy visualization as line plot for more modulation technique is messy.GUI interface for diff snr value. 

**The Modulation Techniques Used**
Phase Shift Keying (PSK):
1. BPSK – baseline, most robust, lowest spectral efficiency
2. QPSK – standard in many systems like LTE
3. OQPSK – refinement of QPSK for spectral shaping
4. π/4-QPSK – differential phase QPSK, used in fading channels
5. 8PSK – higher spectral efficiency than QPSK
6. 16PSK – even higher PSK, less common due to BER
 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM):
7. 64QAM – widely used in LTE/Wi-Fi
8. 256QAM – higher data rate, lower noise robustness
 Differential:
9. DPSK – differential encoding without coherent detection
 Multi-Carrier:
10. OFDM – robust multi-carrier scheme (can include QAM inside)
